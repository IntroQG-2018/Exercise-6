# Exercise 6: Quantitative thermochronology, part I

This exercise is part 1 of the exercises on thermochronology.
In this exercise you will run a time-dependent 1D heat transfer model, plot predicted geotherms, and predict thermochronometer ages for several thermochronometers.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.
Don't forget to include clear comments that explain what happens in each section of your code cells.

- **Exercise 6 is due by the start of class on on 10.12.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L6/exercise-6.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.
